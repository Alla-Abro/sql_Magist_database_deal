# Title: sql_Magist_database_deal
## decscription: business project about Eniac signing the deal with Magist

Project goals:
- practice analyzing and extracting the data from the dataset provided by WBS to answer business questions using MySQL
- practice working on both MySQL and Tableau Public to prepare our recommendations for the CEO
- practice effective business presentations
  
Project description: we are provided with a snapshot of Magist's dataset (a fictious Brazilian e-commerce platform similar to eBay) to analyze it and give the recommendations to the Eniac's CEO (a fictious company in Spain that specializes on Apple compatible accessories and wishes to sell their products in Brazil. Therefore Eniac is planning to sign a 3-year contract with Magist to set up warehouses, deliveries etc.)

## 2 Main business questions:

- Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.
- Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?
